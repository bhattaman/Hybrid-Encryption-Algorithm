 <h1> Hybrid-Encryption-Algorithm </h1>
This is the c implementation of an hybrid encryption algorithm using AES and Blowfish written entirely in c. <br />
File 1: Text Message to be encrypted <br />
File 2: Cipher text stored <br />
File 3: Text Message Decrypted again. <br />
If everything goes on well, you must get same File1 and File 3.<br /> <br />

AES-128  is used - 10 rounds encryption <br />
Blowfish implemented for 64-bit plaintext and key length same as that given for AES by the user <br />
Scopes of improvization still left.
Suggestions are welcome.
Happy Coding :-)
